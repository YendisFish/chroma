# Chroma

Chroma is a programming language that is intuitive,
powerful, and and bounds free. Writen in and inspired
by Go, Chroma runs on the [Rainbow runtime](https://github.com/luminous-foundation/Rainbow).
This allows Chroma to deliver you a powerful and flushed out ecosystem,
while also building to multiple architechtures!

# Why Chroma?

Chroma finds that the modern state of programming ultimately ends with
the programmer negotiating with their code. This is no fun! Especially
when you're in the zone. The rules and management placed into the
ecosystem of languages like Java, C#, Dart, and JS, all limit the programmer
from doing what they *want* to do. Chroma will not do this to you. Chroma
allows the programmer to code in whatever way they want.

# What does Chroma look like?

Here is a simple Hello, World written in Chroma. For more examples you can see
our [spec](spec.md).

```go
package main

import io

func main() {
    io.println(first := "Hello, World!", first.length)
}
```
